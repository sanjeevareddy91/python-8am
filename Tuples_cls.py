# Tuples -- Sequence of elements seperated with comma(,) declared inside ( ).

a = (43,87,'python',67.8,13,[45,46,47])

# print(a)

# print(type(a))

b = 43,87,'python',67.8,13,[45,46,47]

# print(b)

# Accessing the elements inside the sequence..(indexing)

# Indexing starts from 0 ..

print(a[0])

# print(a[1:5])

# print(a[0:6:2])

# Negative indexing will start from -1..

# print(a[-4])

# print(a[::-1])

# Tuples are immutables .. 

# Once a tuple is declared we cannot make changes to the tuple..

# a[0] = 54

# only 2 methods inside the tuples..

# index : It will return the index value of the element inside the sequence.
# count : It will return how many times a particular element is repeated inside the sequence.


# a = (43,87,'python',67.8,13,[45,46,47])


# print(a.index(13))

# print(a.count(43))
print("Hello")
